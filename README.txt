HOW TO PLAY:

To play these notes you may first want to go thorugh and learn what each string is. Basic guitar setup from left(Low-E) to right(High-E). In order to play these notes you will have to run your left hand over them, when played the string will light up and the note will appear about the string you are playing.

When using your left hand to play notes (After the notes are learned), in order to avoid playing notes in between the note you want and the next note in the sequence is to your your right hand. by placing your right hand over the red rectangle in the bottom right hand corner it prevents your left hand from playing any of the notes you may pass over while onto the next note in the sequence.

To keep track of the sequnce that has been finished thus far, pay attention to the left side of the screen. When the note is red that means that you have completed it, when it is green it mean it is yet to be played. They follow in order from top to bottom and playing a note not in the sequence will result in the sequence restarting. Once the sequnce is complete, you will gain one point and all will be well!
